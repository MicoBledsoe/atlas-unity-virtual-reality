  This README outlines our VR projects focusing on immersive experiences. We've developed several applications leveraging 3DOF and 6DOF, offering both stationary and exploratory environments in virtual reality. Key features include realistic object interactions, customizable VR locomotion methods to minimize motion sickness, and user-friendly interfaces for seamless navigation. Our projects are tested extensively in VR for optimal performance and user engagement. Here, we detail the setup, functionalities, and unique aspects of each VR application, alongside guidelines for use and technical requirements.
